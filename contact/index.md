[See our leadership team](/officers/).

For those who do not already take advantage of our $2.1M Air Traffic Control Simulator, try visiting during Open Lab hours, as listed on our calendar. Many KAO officers will be working during Open Labs and able to answer questions you have to help you master the art of Air Traffic Control. No experience required; just come on down, and we'll show you all you want to know. Trust us: you'll love it.
